## Description

p5JS is a creative code JavaScript library focused on making coding easy for artists. Their language syntax is easy to learn and execute, making it simple for users to make something quick and wonderful.

For my interest in pen plotters, such as the Axidraw, I use the p5.SVG library extension. This creates an SVG file inside the canvas that can be downloaded and loaded into any vector graphics editor.
