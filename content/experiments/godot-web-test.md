## Description

A small experiment to test web exports of Godot projects.

## Instructions

Move the purple square with the Arrow Keys.

## Thoughts

This had to be made in Godot 3 because of Godot 4's new requirements for browser permissions. There is this
[plugin](https://github.com/nisovin/godot-coi-serviceworker) to resolve the Godot 4 requirements, but I couldn't get it to work.
